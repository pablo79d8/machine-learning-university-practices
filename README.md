# Machine Learning University Practices

This repository contains practical assignments developed as part of a university course on **machine learning** and its applications. Each notebook explores different fundamental topics and techniques within the field, ranging from unsupervised learning algorithms to deep learning models.

## Contents

- **P1_kmedias_aglom.ipynb**  
  *K-means and Agglomerative Clustering*:  
  Introduction to unsupervised learning techniques for grouping data. The notebook covers both K-means clustering and agglomerative (hierarchical) clustering methods.

- **P2_kmedias_init.ipynb**  
  *K-means Initialization Methods*:  
  Study and comparison of different initialization strategies for the K-means clustering algorithm, analyzing their impact on performance and clustering quality.

- **P3_SOM_MLP.ipynb**  
  *Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)*:  
  Exploration of self-organizing maps for unsupervised data visualization and clustering, as well as multilayer perceptrons (a type of feedforward neural network) for supervised classification tasks.

- **P4_RNNs.ipynb**  
  *Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)*:  
  Implementation and experimentation with RNN architectures, focusing on their application to sequence and time series data within deep learning.

- **P5_CONVOLUCIONALES.ipynb**  
  *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)*:  
  Study of convolutional neural networks, with applications mainly in image recognition and computer vision tasks.

## Structure

All notebooks are written in Python using Jupyter Notebook format. Each assignment contains both theoretical explanations and practical code examples.
